## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Visualize multichannel signal inputs with an intuitive interface.
- **Prediction Mode**: Forecast future signal trends using LSTM models.
- **Classification Mode**: Train models to recognize labeled signal states (e.g., stress vs. baseline).
- **Anomaly Detection Mode**: Detect unusual or potentially dangerous signal patterns using autoencoders.
- **Signal Plotting**: Compare before-and-after training visualizations.
